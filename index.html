# [WIP ] lexical-playground-only

The idea is to have https://github.com/facebook/lexical/tree/main/packages/lexical-playground as a separate, lean repo bundlable as a single JS file to be used as a simple client-side markdown editor with usage API similar to https://github.com/quilljs/quill (and usable in vanilla HTML/JS without mandatory usage of package managers/bundlers/react)

Based on the broken release https://github.com/facebook/lexical/releases/tag/v0.12.5: https://github.com/facebook/lexical/discussions/5392

- do this
- do that
